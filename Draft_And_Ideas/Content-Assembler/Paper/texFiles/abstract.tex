Most company websites are implemented on top of a Content Management System (CMS). Even though CMSs are simpler to use than pure static HTML sites, their configuration still require technical knowledge (database configuration, installation of plug-ins,...) that no all end-users have.
  
In this sense, we propose a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that enables to non-expert users to easily indicate their configuration preferences (in terms of functionalities, appearance, default content, ...). As notation for our DSL we adopt the mind-mapping syntax which is easy to learn and familiar for many users. Our approach has been implemented for WordPress, and an experimentation has been carried out with end-users to measure its usefulness.
