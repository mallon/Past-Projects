Indeed, 'Dictator' is close to what I am doing for WordPress, but:
- It is valid only for WordPress (it uses' WP-CLI'), while our DSL can be
extended to other CMS.
- It only uses a Command Line Interface, then we have:
* A graphical interface, which is the mind-mapping. The benefits of mind mapping is that it is
more readable than YAML, JSON, XML or other textual data formats. It allows to have a
faster and a more understandable vision of the different website elements to manage.
* A textual interface (for web-designers) : they choose to use YAML, but our format is more
specific to our DSL. So because it is more verbose, it is more understandable in the specific case
of CMS configuration.
